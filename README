Trully... there's a story behind this random squares. Once in the tech high school,
me and @otaviobp (http://github.com/otaviobp) have done a simple file crypto tool,
really simple (Pascal...)

We've showed our colleagues and they didn't get excited. "Oh, nice...". That's
all we heard. We've got nervous and created a random pixel plotter using 
Graphics unit in Pascal.

Like 5-minute-work... suddenlly, everybody was around us asking "Wow, dudes!
How did you do that!? Tell us!!"

Conclusion? Bah... backend software doesn't make girls impressed :D
